# Places for improvement

(Frontend)
Task says "Minimum loan period can be 12 months" which the slider follows correctly 
the text under the slider shows "6 months" which is misleading.

In DecisionEngines method getCreditModifier it is not clear why the chosen ranges are as they are
since the credit modifier calculation isn't explicitly explained anywhere in the task description 
other than it's based on last 4 digits and the ranges don't align with given examples.

Most important shortcoming:
In the calculation of loan amounts there isn't a correct credit scoring algorithm used 
that was provided in the task description.
